"# Google-Map-Component"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhimanyusingh/Google-Map-Component.git
cd react-express-starter
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

You can start the server on its own with the command:

```bash
npm run server
```

Run the React application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Run both applications together with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.
